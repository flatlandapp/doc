# 2. TW Protocol: Decentralized AI Agents

The TW Protocol (The Weavers Protocol) is an innovative decentralized protocol designed to address the decentralization of operational logic in Web3 games. By migrating game character behavior logic from centralized servers to local AI agents on players' devices, the TW Protocol achieves true decentralization at the game logic level.

The core innovation of the TW Protocol lies in its use of decentralized AI agents (called "Weavers") to control game character behavior, while utilizing blockchain technology to verify the legitimacy of these actions. This design not only eliminates the single point of failure risk associated with centralized servers but also provides players with a completely new gaming experience.

This chapter will detail the core concepts, technical architecture, mathematical models, MCP tool applications, and smart contract design of the TW Protocol, demonstrating how this protocol fundamentally changes the operation of Web3 games.
