# 6. Character Behavior Control

Character behavior control is one of the core innovations of the TW protocol, fundamentally changing how players interact with game characters and creating an unprecedented gaming experience. This chapter will delve into the design philosophy, technical implementation, and philosophical significance of this innovative mechanism.

In traditional games, players directly control specific character behaviors through input devices like keyboards, mice, or controllers, with characters being direct extensions of player will. In games designed with the TW protocol, character behaviors are entirely controlled by AI agents ("Weavers") running locally on the player's device, while players transition to the roles of observers and guides.

This fundamental transformation not only presents new challenges for game technology but also redefines the relationship between players and virtual characters, creating a more authentic and natural virtual world experience. This chapter will detail various aspects of this innovative mechanism, exploring its technical implementation, application scenarios, and deeper philosophical implications.
