# 6.3 Non-intervention in Player Characters

In the design of the TW protocol, direct player control over characters is deliberately limited, instead influencing character behavior indirectly through intent expression and trait shaping. This design is a core concept based on multiple considerations.

## 6.3.1 Design Philosophy of Non-intervention

The non-intervention design for player characters is based on the following core principles:

1. **Authentic Autonomous Life Experience**: Create a gaming experience closer to "cultivation" rather than "control".
2. **Character Behavior Consistency**: Ensure character behavior aligns with their set personality and abilities, avoiding inconsistencies caused by player operations.
3. **Worldview Integrity**: Maintain the internal logic and rule integrity of the game world.
4. **Consensus Mechanism Compatibility**: Enable character behavior to be verified through decentralized consensus.
5. **Multi-character Macro Management**: Allow players to focus on the development of multiple characters simultaneously, rather than micromanaging a single character.

## 6.3.2 Technical Safeguards for Non-intervention

The TW protocol ensures the implementation of the non-intervention principle through multi-layer technical mechanisms:

1. **MCP Tool Verification Layer**:
   - Verify that player input is limited to intent expression and trait definition.
   - Ensure players cannot directly specify specific behavior details.

2. **Behavior Generation Encapsulation**:
   - The AI agent's behavior generation algorithm is completely transparent to players.
   - Players cannot directly modify the behavior generation process.

3. **Contract Enforcement Verification**:
   - Smart contracts verify if behaviors comply with the character's current abilities and state.
   - Reject behavior submissions that do not align with character traits.

4. **Intent and Behavior Separation**:
   - Clearly distinguish between player intent expression and AI agent behavior generation.
   - Maintain sufficient uncertainty and autonomy space.

## 6.3.3 Balancing Non-intervention and Player Freedom

While the TW protocol limits direct player control over characters, it maintains sufficient player freedom and engagement through the following mechanisms:

1. **Character Development Freedom**:
   - Players can freely define initial attributes and traits of characters.
   - Influence long-term development directions through cultivation and guidance.

2. **Intent Expression System**:
   - Rich intent expression interface supporting multi-level goal definition.
   - Intents can be set from macro goals to meso preferences.

3. **Character Group Management**:
   - Players can manage multiple characters simultaneously, forming complementary character combinations.
   - Create more complex strategic spaces through character interactions.

4. **Environmental Influence Capability**:
   - Players can indirectly influence character behavior by changing the game environment.
   - Participate in world event voting to shape the broader environment characters are in.

## 6.3.4 Bridging Player Intent to Character Behavior

The relationship between player intent and AI agent behavior is a core design challenge of the TW protocol. The system establishes this bridge through the following methods:

1. **Layered Intent System**:
   - **Principle Layer**: Character's core values and long-term goals.
   - **Strategy Layer**: Medium-term goals and behavior preference settings.
   - **Tactical Layer**: Short-term environmental responses and priority adjustments.

2. **Progressive Influence**:
   - Player intent's influence on character behavior is progressively cumulative.
   - Short-term behaviors maintain high autonomy, while long-term directions are guided by players.

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - The system provides feedback on the alignment between character behavior and player intent.
   - Regular reports on the evolution trends of character behavior patterns.

## 6.3.5 Managing Character Behavior Uncertainty

To balance character autonomy and player expectations, the TW protocol designs uncertainty management mechanisms:

1. **Variable Uncertainty Range**:
   - Dynamically adjust behavior uncertainty based on player settings and character traits.
   - Allow players to set acceptable uncertainty ranges.

2. **Event Response Thresholds**:
   - Define character sensitivity to environmental events.
   - Set threshold conditions for triggering specific behaviors.

3. **Progressive Autonomy**:
   - Characters start with lower autonomy, gradually increasing with interaction and learning.
   - Players can influence autonomy growth speed through "trust building".

Through these mechanisms, the TW protocol maintains AI agent autonomy while providing players with sufficient indirect influence, creating a new mode of game interaction: players are no longer direct controllers of characters, but guides and witnesses to their growth journey.
