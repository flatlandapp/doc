# 7.1 Privacy Protection Measures

While implementing decentralization, the TW and TLF protocols also place high importance on user privacy protection, especially in scenarios where AI agents access user behavior data.

## 7.1.1 Privacy Design Principles

The protocol's privacy protection is based on the following core principles:

1. **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process the minimum data necessary to perform essential functions
2. **Local Processing Priority**: Process sensitive data on the user's local device whenever possible
3. **Informed Consent**: Clearly inform users about data usage and obtain consent
4. **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)**: Apply technologies like encryption and zero-knowledge proofs
5. **On-chain/Off-chain Data Separation**: Store sensitive data off-chain, with only necessary information on-chain

## 7.1.2 Core Privacy Protection Technologies

The TW and TLF protocols employ various advanced privacy protection technologies:

| **Technology** | **Application Scenario** | **Privacy Protection Role** |
|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Zero-Knowledge Proof** | Character behavior verification | Prove behavior legality without revealing specific details |
| **Homomorphic Encryption** | Collective voting calculation | Compute voting results in encrypted state |
| **Secure Multi-party Computation** | Cross-player interaction | Collaborative computation without revealing individual inputs |
| **Differential Privacy** | Statistical data release | Publish aggregated data while protecting individual privacy |
| **Off-chain Storage** | Character attribute data | Store sensitive attributes locally, with only hashes on-chain |

## 7.1.3 Privacy Protection in MCP Tools

MCP tools play a crucial role in privacy protection:

1. **Local Semantic Understanding**:
   - Analyze and process player intent on local devices
   - Avoid transmitting sensitive instructions to external servers
   - Protect player game strategies and preference privacy

2. **Secure Data Channels**:
   - Use encrypted channels for blockchain interactions
   - Prevent man-in-the-middle eavesdropping and tampering
   - Hide transaction specifics, only revealing necessary information

3. **Privacy-Preserving Queries**:
   - Support queries on encrypted data
   - Query results don't reveal underlying data
   - Allow data validity verification without exposing content

4. **Selective Disclosure**:
   - Allow players precise control over which character data to share
   - Support verifiable partial information disclosure
   - Create different privacy levels for various scenarios

## 7.1.4 Data Lifecycle Protection

The TW and TLF protocols implement comprehensive privacy protection measures throughout the data lifecycle:

1. **Data Generation Phase**:
   - Generate character attributes and behavior preferences locally
   - Encrypt and store sensitive features
   - User control over which data can be collected

2. **Data Storage Phase**:
   - Hierarchical storage architecture, keeping sensitive data local
   - Only store encrypted data or hash references on-chain
   - Key management systems ensure only authorized access

3. **Data Processing Phase**:
   - Execute privacy-preserving computations locally
   - Use zero-knowledge proofs for on-chain verification
   - Implement anonymous credential mechanisms for player voting

4. **Data Sharing Phase**:
   - Controlled sharing based on explicit user consent
   - De-identification and anonymization processing
   - Data usage scope and time limitations

5. **Data Deletion Phase**:
   - Clear data expiration policies
   - Secure data erasure mechanisms
   - Complete off-chain data deletion, marking on-chain data as invalid

## 7.2.5 Balancing Privacy and Transparency

The TW and TLF protocols carefully balance privacy protection and system transparency:

1. **Selective Transparency**:
   - Fully transparent public game states
   - Private character data by default, with optional disclosure
   - Fully transparent system parameters and rules

2. **Anonymity and Pseudonymity**:
   - Support distinguishing between player identity and character identity
   - Allow creation of multiple isolated character identities
   - Provide character anonymity while maintaining verifiable behavior

3. **Auditability**:
   - Key system behaviors can be audited and verified
   - Personal privacy data remains protected
   - Use zero-knowledge proofs for data-free audits

4. **Transparency Options**:
   - Players can choose to participate in public leaderboards
   - Governance voting can be anonymous or public
   - Selective display of character achievements
