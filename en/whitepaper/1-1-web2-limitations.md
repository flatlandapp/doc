# 1.1 Limitations of Web2 Games

The traditional Web2 gaming model has developed for decades. While it has continuously innovated in technology and user experience, its centralized nature has led to a series of fundamental issues. These problems not only affect player experience but also limit the long-term sustainable development of the gaming industry.

## Core Limitations of Web2 Games

| **Limitation** | **Manifestation** | **Potential Impact** |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Lack of Asset Ownership** | In-game items purchased by players are completely controlled by game companies | Assets are completely lost when games shut down, cannot be transferred across platforms |
| **Centralization Risks** | Reliance on single server infrastructure | Game becomes unavailable during server downtime, high risk of single point of failure |
| **Governance Deficiency** | Developers have complete decision-making power | Players cannot participate in game rule-making, interests are misaligned |
| **Economic Isolation** | In-game economy is isolated from real economy | Players' time investment is difficult to translate into real value returns |
| **Innovation Constraints** | Fixed business models limit innovation space | Game types and gameplay tend to become homogenized |

These limitations have led to conflicts between players and developers, as well as imbalanced value capture in the gaming ecosystem. With the development of blockchain technology, Web3 games have emerged to address these fundamental issues.
