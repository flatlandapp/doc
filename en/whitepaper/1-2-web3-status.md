Web3 games have made breakthrough progress in asset ownership through the introduction of blockchain technology. However, current Web3 games still face numerous challenges, particularly in the decentralization of game logic and governance mechanisms.

Although Web3 games are continuously evolving, most current Web3 games still have the following issues:

1. **Centralized Game Logic**: Core game logic (such as character behavior and event triggers) still runs on centralized servers. Once the server encounters problems, the gaming experience will be severely affected.

2. **Limitations in Governance**: Most Web3 games' governance mechanisms are limited to macro-level decisions (such as economic parameter adjustments) and cannot achieve dynamic governance of game content.

3. **Lack of Dynamism**: Players have limited influence on the game world. Game content updates still rely on developers, lacking self-evolution capabilities.

4. **Trade-off Between Technology and Experience**: Many Web3 games sacrifice gaming experience and performance while pursuing decentralization, resulting in poor user experience.
