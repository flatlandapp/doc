# 5. Differences from Existing Game Modes

The game ecosystem created by the TW and TLF protocols is fundamentally different from traditional Web2 games and existing Web3 games. These differences are not only reflected in the technical architecture but also in game design philosophy, user experience, economic models, and other aspects.

This chapter will provide a detailed analysis of the differences between TW+TLF game modes and existing game modes, including comparisons with traditional Web2 games, differences from existing Web3 games, and comprehensive technical comparisons. Through these comparisons, we can more clearly see how the TW+TLF protocol redefines the gaming experience and its innovations in addressing the limitations of existing games.

These differences exist not merely for technological innovation but to solve actual user pain points and enhance the gaming experience. By understanding these differences, we can better grasp the value proposition and potential impact of the TW+TLF protocol.
