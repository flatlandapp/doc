# Flatworld AI Game Overview

## üåê Game Background

Flatworld AI is a blockchain-based AI game inspired by Edwin A. Abbott's classic novel "Flatland." In this unique world, you will explore a two-dimensional society composed of geometric shapes and experience a new style of gameplay.

### Setting Background

In the Flatworld, residents are various geometric shapes living on a two-dimensional plane. The social structure is determined by the shape and number of sides of the characters, from simple triangles to complex polygons, to perfect circles, each shape representing different social classes and abilities.

As a real player, you do not directly control these residents, but instead observe and guide AI-controlled autonomous characters (NPCs) from a "god's-eye view," witnessing their lives, interactions, and growth in this flat world.

## üéÆ Game Core Concepts

Flatworld AI revolutionizes traditional gameplay with three core innovations:

### 1. Blockchain Asset Ownership

Each resident is a unique NFT, fully owned by players, featuring:
- Unique shape and attributes
- Transferable ownership
- Upgradable abilities
- Cross-platform usable assets

### 2. AI Agent Autonomous Behavior

Unlike traditional games where players directly control characters, in Flatworld AI:
- Characters are controlled by AI agents with autonomous decision-making abilities
- Players become observers and guides rather than direct controllers
- AI agents act based on character traits, environment, and player intent
- Each character exhibits unique "personality" and behavior patterns

### 3. Decentralized Game Logic

The game's core logic is implemented through smart contracts and decentralized technology:
- Character behavior is generated by local AI agents, not dependent on central servers
- Smart contracts verify behavior legitimacy, ensuring game rules are followed
- Game states are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and permanence
- Players collectively maintain and witness the evolution of the game world

## üí° Gameplay Features

### God's-Eye View Observation

As a player, you will observe this vibrant flat world from a god's-eye view, witnessing AI characters' interactions and social development. You can:
- Observe characters' daily activities and social interactions
- Analyze town development and prosperity changes
- Witness important events and historical moments
- Collect and share interesting character stories

### AI Strategy Events

The game incorporates a "Strategy" mechanism based on classic game theory, demonstrated in various scenarios:
- Resource allocation and knowledge sharing decisions between residents
- Collective action problems in town construction and crisis response
- Cooperation and betrayal decisions in global events such as natural disasters
- Unique effects of character shape and attributes on dilemma strategies

### Intent Guidance Rather Than Direct Control

You cannot directly control characters' specific actions, but can guide them through setting intents and goals:
- Set characters' long-term goals and values
- Provide environmental clues and task hints
- Create specific situations for characters to make choices
- Cultivate specific abilities and skills for characters

### Town Development and Migration

The game world consists of multiple towns, each with unique characteristics and development states:
- Town prosperity affects residents' quality of life and opportunities
- Residents can migrate between different towns in search of better lives
- Players can indirectly influence town development through character choices
- Complex economic and social networks form between towns

## üéØ Game Objectives

In Flatworld AI, there is no traditional "winning the game," but rather focuses on the following experiences:

1. **Nurture and Witness**: Cultivate your AI characters and witness their growth and development in the flat world
2. **Collect and Upgrade**: Collect characters of different shapes and abilities, improving their attributes and social status
3. **Explore and Discover**: Explore the mysteries of the flat world, discovering hidden stories and opportunities
4. **Community and Economy**: Participate in community building, trading assets and services in the game economy
5. **Create and Share**: Create unique character stories, sharing your experiences with other players

Flatworld AI is not just a game, but an ongoing virtual social experiment where each player is a participant and witness to this experiment.
