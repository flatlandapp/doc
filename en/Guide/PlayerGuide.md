3. **Relationship Network**
   - View the character's relationship network with other residents
   - Understand social interaction patterns and development
   - Observe interactions between different social classes

### Guiding Character Development

Although you cannot directly control characters, you can guide their development through various means:

1. **Attribute Management**
   - Adjust character traits through attribute packing and unpacking
   - Enhance specific attributes to influence character behavioral tendencies
   - Optimize attribute combinations for different scenarios

2. **Environment Selection**
   - Decide whether the character should stay in the current town or migrate
   - Choose the most suitable environment for character development
   - Consider town prosperity, population, and opportunities

3. **Goal Setting**
   - Set long-term development goals for the character
   - Create development paths that fit the character's traits
   - Regularly adjust goals to adapt to new situations

### Attribute Packing and Unpacking

Attribute management is your main way to influence character development:

#### Attribute Packing (Converting to Tokens)

1. Select your character and click "Attribute Management"
2. Choose the attribute to pack (courage, wisdom, or perception)
3. Specify the amount to pack (1-98, must retain at least 1 point)
4. Confirm the transaction and pay Gas fee
5. After the transaction completes, you will receive corresponding attribute tokens

#### Attribute Unpacking (Converting Back to Attribute Points)

1. Ensure you have enough attribute tokens
2. Select the character to enhance
3. Choose the attribute type to increase
4. Specify the number of tokens to convert
5. Confirm the transaction and pay Gas fee
6. After the transaction completes, the character's corresponding attribute will increase

### Town Migration

When you want your character to explore new environments, you can arrange town migration:

1. **Migration Preparation**
   - Check the character's perception value (determines maximum migration distance)
   - Check the character's courage value (determines migration consumption)
   - Check available towns' prosperity and opportunities

2. **Migration Execution**
   - Select the character and click "Migrate"
   - Select the destination town on the map (distance must be within perception's allowed range)
   - Confirm migration and pay courage consumption
   - Wait for migration to complete, the character will appear in the new town

3. **Post-Migration Adaptation**
   - Observe how the character adapts to the new environment
   - Note changes in the new town's prosperity (affected by character's wisdom)
   - Observe the character starting to establish a new social network

## 🎯 Advanced Strategy Guide

### Character Development Paths

Based on a character's basic attribute combination, different development paths can be planned:

#### Explorer Path (High Courage)

Suitable for characters with high courage values:
- Frequently migrate to different towns exploring new opportunities
- Prioritize enhancing perception value to increase exploration range
- Look for towns with low prosperity but development potential

#### Sage Path (High Wisdom)

Suitable for characters with high wisdom values:
- Choose and reside long-term in a single town
- Enhance town prosperity through wisdom value
- Become a core contributor to town development

#### Observer Path (High Perception)

Suitable for characters with high perception values:
- Balance migration and settlement, obtaining broad information
- Discover and share opportunities between towns
- Play a connector role in the town network

### Town Selection Strategy

Choosing the right town is crucial for character development:

1. **Emerging Town Strategy**
   - Choose new towns with relatively low prosperity but high growth potential
   - Gain greater influence as an early resident
   - Grow together with town development

2. **Mature Town Strategy**
   - Choose established towns with high prosperity
   - Utilize existing resources and opportunities
   - Find specialization directions in a competitive environment

3. **Diversified Town Network**
   - Have multiple characters distributed in different types of towns
   - Create a diverse character portfolio
   - Test different strategies in different environments

### Token Management Strategy

Effective token management can maximize your resource value:

1. **Attribute Optimization**
   - Analyze character's current needs, reallocating attribute points
   - Pack excess attributes into tokens for storage
   - Unpack tokens to strengthen specific attributes when needed

2. **Market Trading**
   - Purchase low-priced attribute tokens in the market
   - Sell high-demand attribute tokens
   - Profit from price differences

3. **Long-term Investment**
   - Reserve attribute tokens for future character development
   - Predict attribute demand trends for advance positioning
   - Build balanced reserves of various tokens

## 📘 Advanced Concepts

### Shape Evolution

As attributes improve, a character's shape gradually evolves:

1. **Increase in Number of Sides**
   - Increasing total attribute value increases the character's number of sides
   - Increased sides represent improved social status
   - Evolution from simple shapes (triangles) to complex shapes (near circles)

2. **Social Mobility**
   - Shape changes reflect social class mobility
   - Achieve upward mobility through strategic attribute management
   - Observe social interaction patterns between characters of different shapes

### Town Prosperity Impact

Prosperity is the core indicator of town development:

1. **Prosperity Sources**
   - Residents' wisdom values directly contribute to prosperity
   - Every 10 points of wisdom adds 1 point of prosperity
   - Resident immigration increases, emigration decreases prosperity

2. **Prosperity Effects**
   - Prosperity affects town birth rate (new character creation limit)
   - Every 10-point increase in prosperity increases birth rate by 10%
   - Higher prosperity towns provide more opportunities and resources

### Understanding AI Behavior Patterns

Understanding AI behavior patterns can help you better predict and guide characters:

1. **Attribute Influence**
   - High courage characters tend toward adventure and proactive behavior
   - High wisdom characters tend toward thinking and strategic decision-making
   - High perception characters are more sensitive to environmental changes and opportunities

2. **Environmental Adaptation**
   - Characters adjust behavior based on town characteristics
   - High prosperity towns promote more active social interactions
   - Population density affects social network formation

3. **Long-term Consistency**
   - AI maintains long-term consistency in character behavior
   - Major changes require time to adapt and integrate
   - Sudden environmental changes may trigger new behavior patterns
