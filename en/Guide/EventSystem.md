# Flatworld AI Event System and AI Strategy

## üìÖ Event System Overview

In the two-dimensional world of Flatworld AI, various events occur randomly or as planned, bringing changes and challenges to this AI-driven society. The event system is the core source of the game's dynamism and unpredictability, as well as an important catalyst for character behavioral decisions and social interactions.

### Event Types

The event system in Flatworld AI is divided into the following main categories:

1. **Local Events**: Events affecting specific characters or small groups of characters
2. **Town Events**: Events affecting all residents and development of an entire town
3. **Global Events**: Large-scale events affecting multiple towns or the entire game world
4. **Seasonal Events**: Events that occur periodically according to the game world's time cycle

## üîÑ AI Strategy Mechanism

### Core Concept

The AI Strategy is a core interaction mechanism in Flatworld AI, based on the classic Strategy model in game theory. In this scenario, characters face situations where they need to choose between cooperation or betrayal, with their decisions affecting not only themselves but also other participants.

This mechanism is ingeniously integrated into multiple levels of the game, allowing AI characters to exhibit different strategy tendencies through autonomous decision-making, adding depth and unpredictability to the game.

### Scoring Mechanism

The basic scoring matrix for AI Strategy events is as follows:

| Character A \ Character B | Cooperate(C)  | Betray(D)      |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Cooperate(C)  | 3 points, 3 points | 0 points, 5 points |
| Betray(D)  | 5 points, 0 points | 1 point, 1 point |

- Both cooperate: Each gets 3 points (win-win)
- One cooperates, one betrays: Betrayer gets 5 points, cooperator gets 0 points (exploitation)
- Both betray: Each gets 1 point (lose-lose)

This scoring design ensures the core characteristic of the Strategy: "In the short term, betrayal is the optimal strategy, but in the long term, cooperation produces the best collective result."

## üìä Shape Influence and Character Attributes

### Shape Influence

In Flatworld AI, a character's shape (based on number of sides) has a significant impact on their performance in the Strategy:

| Shape Category | Privilege | Tendency | Special Ability |
|---------|------|------|---------|
| **Triangle**<br>(0-50 sides) | Gain extra 0.5 points when betraying | More inclined toward betrayal strategies | Can predict opponent's next move once every 5 rounds |
| **Quadrilateral**<br>(51-70 sides) | Gain extra 0.3 points when both cooperate | Tend toward tit-for-tat strategies | Can negate betrayal penalty once every 7 rounds |
| **Polygon**<br>(71-90 sides) | Gain extra 1 point after three consecutive cooperations | Tend toward forgiving strategies | Can view opponent's historical decision patterns |
| **Near Circle**<br>(91-99 sides) | Gain 0.5 extra points when changing strategy | Tend toward flexible strategies | Can remake a past decision once every 8 rounds |

### Attribute Influence

A character's three basic attributes directly influence their behavioral tendencies and success rates in the Strategy:

- **Courage**: Affects the probability of betrayal decisions and additional benefits when betraying
  - High courage value: Increases betrayal benefits, improves recovery ability when facing betrayal
  - Low courage value: Reduces betrayal probability, increases stability of continuous cooperation

- **Wisdom**: Affects the complexity and adaptability of strategy selection
  - High wisdom value: Able to identify more complex patterns, adopt more advanced strategies
  - Low wisdom value: Strategies are simple and direct, may be more predictable

- **Perception**: Affects the accuracy of predicting opponent's behavior
  - High perception value: Improves ability to predict opponent's next move
  - Low perception value: Reduces prediction ability, but may have more consistent behavior patterns

## üé≠ Event Types and Strategy

### Local Event Examples
