## Dynamic NFT System

### Flatworld NFT: Beyond Static Artwork

Flatworld NFT is a **unique collection of 2D characters**, inspired by the famous Flatland (Flatworld). In this geometric setting, each NFT represents a unique life form controlled by its own AI agent. These are **not ordinary NFTs** - they are driven by AI agents and exhibit changing colors, outlines, and intelligence.

In Crypto Flatworld, each NFT is not just artwork, it is a **living entity** with a complete life, controlled by its own AI agent. These agents navigate, make decisions, adapt, and integrate into the future of this vibrant virtual environment.

While players cannot directly control the characters, through the evolving NFT capabilities, you participate in the collective governance of the game, decision-making events, and law-making. Your NFT will become a wise scholar, brave warrior, or even a mysterious thinker. Evolve and strengthen to become a core contributor to Flatworld. Join this exploration and become a central part of a digitally governed metaverse - true, harmonious, and filled with intelligent AI exchanges.

> *"Will your NFT become a wise scholar, a brave warrior, or a mysterious thinker? The possibilities are limitless."*

### AI-Controlled Life Forms

In the blockchain flatland, each NFT is not merely artwork, but a life form controlled by its own AI agent. These agents have vibrant energy to navigate the game environment, make decisions, form alliances, adapt, and shape the future.

As a player, you are not just an observer—you are a god of this 2D universe, and while you cannot directly control your character, you can exert influence through your NFT, participating in collective governance, decision-making events, and law-making, guiding the destiny of this geometric realm.

#### Key Features:

| **Shape Levels** | From 3 → 99 sides (triangle to near-circle) |
| **Autonomous Decision-Making** | AI-driven behavior patterns |
| **Attribute Evolution** | Real-time updated properties and abilities |

### Beyond Static Fixed Models - Embracing True Digital Life

## NFT Mapping to AI Attributes

Flatworld NFTs not only have visual representation but also map to a complex AI attribute system that directly influences the behavior patterns and decision-making abilities of the AI agent:

### AI Core Attributes

| Attribute | Impact Range | Typical Value |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Logic** | Affects the agent's ability to analyze situations and make rational decisions | 1-99 |
| **Creativity** | Affects the agent's ability to find new solutions and adapt to changes | 1-99 |
| **Morality** | Affects the agent's tendency to choose cooperation or betrayal in dilemmas | 1-99 |
| **Decisiveness** | Affects the agent's ability to make decisions quickly, avoiding indecision | 1-99 |

These AI attributes determine how your NFT reacts and adapts in various scenarios, making each NFT a truly unique entity with personalized behavior patterns and decision tendencies.

## Attribute Changes Directly Impact NFT Appearance and Abilities

In Flatworld, character attributes not only influence behavior but directly change appearance and abilities:

| Attribute | Impact | Visual Change |
|------|------|----------|
| **Courage** | Determines resident's migration ability and adventure spirit; higher courage values enable more frequent migration and exploration | Affects the sharpness of shape edges |
| **Wisdom** | Directly impacts town prosperity and development potential; multiple high-wisdom residents can create synergistic effects | Affects the complexity of the shape |
| **Perception** | Controls exploration range and opportunity discovery; high perception can discover rare resources and predict development opportunities | Affects the symmetry of the shape |

### Shape Evolution System

As your NFT's total attribute value increases, its shape gradually evolves from simple geometric shapes (like triangles) to more complex polygons, eventually approaching a perfect circle, representing an elevation in social status and achievement.

**Shape Evolution Example**:
- Total attribute value: 175 → Current shape: Polygon
- Distance to evolve to near-circle: 25 attribute points

## World View

### Brief History of Flatland

Flatland (Flatworld) was initially pioneered by a group of creative pioneers. They created a unique two-dimensional world where each resident exists with their distinctive shape and color. As time passed, this world gradually developed complex social structures and civilization systems.

### World Geography

Flatland consists of multiple adjacent towns, each like an independent ecosystem:
- **Central Town**: The earliest established town, with the most complete infrastructure and highest prosperity
- **Emerging Towns**: Development zones full of opportunities, waiting for residents' development and construction
- **Specialty Towns**: Each town may develop unique industries and cultural characteristics

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. Attribute System Detailed

Each resident has three core attributes that not only determine the resident's abilities but also influence the development of the entire town:

#### 1.1 Courage
- **Attribute Range**: 1-99
- **Core Function**: Determines resident's migration ability and adventurous spirit
- **Impact Range**:
  * Migration Consumption: Higher courage values can support more frequent migrations
  * Special Events: May affect future adventure tasks and social activities
- **Cultivation Suggestions**:
  * Novice Period: Recommended to maintain between 30-50, sufficient to support basic migration needs
  * Growth Period: Can be enhanced to 60-80, supporting more exploration activities
  * Specialization Period: Can breakthrough 90 based on personal strategy, becoming an adventurer

#### 1.2 Wisdom
- **Attribute Range**: 1-99
- **Core Function**: Directly affects town prosperity and development potential
- **Impact Coefficient**:
  * Prosperity Contribution = Wisdom Value / 10
  * Group Effect: Multiple high-wisdom residents can create synergistic effects
- **Cultivation Strategy**:
  * Early Stage: Prioritize enhancing wisdom, helping the town develop rapidly
  * Middle Stage: Balanced development with other attributes
  * Late Stage: Can flexibly adjust through the attribute token market

#### 1.3 Perception
- **Attribute Range**: 1-99
- **Core Function**: Determines resident's exploration range and ability to discover opportunities
- **Ability Performance**:
  * Migration Range = (Perception Value / 10) + 1
  * Special Discoveries: High perception may bring unique development opportunities
- **Application Scenarios**:
  * Finding new towns
  * Discovering rare resources
  * Predicting development opportunities

### 2. Town System In-Depth Analysis

#### 2.1 Prosperity Mechanism

Town prosperity is a dynamic, multi-dimensional indicator system:

##### Basic Calculation
```
Individual Contribution = Wisdom Value / 10
Total Town Prosperity = Σ(All residents' individual contributions)
```

##### Prosperity Effects
1. **Direct Effects**
   - Enhances town birth rate
   - Increases resource production efficiency
   - Enhances town attractiveness

2. **Indirect Effects**
   - Promotes interactions between residents
   - Brings potential development opportunities
   - Enhances town prestige

#### 2.2 Birth Rate System

The birth rate system employs a dynamic balance mechanism to ensure sustainable town development:

##### Calculation Formula
```
Base Birth Rate = 100
Prosperity Multiplier = (Prosperity * 10) / 100 + 100
Current Birth Rate = (Base Birth Rate * Prosperity Multiplier) / 100
Maximum Birth Rate = Base Birth Rate * 10 = 1000
```

##### Birth Rate Regulation Mechanism
- **Positive Feedback**: Prosperity increases → Birth rate rises → New residents increase → Prosperity further increases
- **Negative Feedback**: Birth rate upper limit ensures growth doesn't spiral out of control
- **Balance Point**: System automatically finds optimal population size

### 3. Resident Characteristic System

#### 3.1 Profession System (0-7)
Each profession has its unique characteristics and development path:
- **Scholar (0)**: Wisdom growth speed is faster
- **Explorer (1)**: Higher initial perception attribute
- **Warrior (2)**: Courage attribute grows faster
- **Merchant (3)**: Gains more trading opportunities
- **Craftsman (4)**: Enhanced production efficiency
- **Artist (5)**: Special creative ability
- **Leader (6)**: Enhances surrounding residents' attributes
- **Hermit (7)**: Unique personal development path

#### 3.2 Gender System (0-1)

- Different genders may receive different development opportunities

#### 3.3 Appearance System
- **Color (0-16)**: Represents personality traits and social status
- **DNA (1-580)**: Determines appearance details and potential abilities
- **Hobbies (0-20)**: Affects social tendencies and development direction

### 4. Attribute Tokenization System
