## 📌 Core Features

![Features](../../images/vsAI.png)

The core features of Flatworld AI Game include:

### AI-Driven Autonomous Characters

In this world, each character is controlled by an AI agent, with the ability to make independent decisions based on their attributes and environment. Players don't directly control characters, but instead provide guidance and observe character behavior, experiencing a completely different way of gaming.

### AI Strategy Social Events

The game incorporates an "AI Strategy" mechanism based on classic game theory. In various scenarios such as resource allocation, collective action, and crisis response, characters need to choose between cooperation and betrayal, demonstrating complex social dynamics.

### Shape-Driven Social Hierarchy

Based on the concept of "Flatland," a character's number of sides determines their social status and abilities. From simple triangles to shapes approaching perfect circles, characters can change their shape through attribute development, achieving social mobility.

### Blockchain Asset Ownership

Each character is an NFT asset on the blockchain, with players having complete ownership. Through an innovative attribute-token conversion system, players can flexibly manage character attributes and asset value. Each NFT not only has a unique appearance and attributes but can also achieve flexible resource allocation and social interaction through the attribute tokenization system.

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Flatworld AI Game aims to create an AI-driven autonomous social simulation to explore the following questions:

- How do AI agents form complex social behaviors under limited rules?
- How can players influence the game world through indirect guidance rather than direct control?
- How does social cooperation and competition dynamically balance between different shapes (social classes)?
- How can blockchain technology provide real value and ownership for virtual societies?

We invite you to become an observer and participant in this social experiment, witnessing the evolution of an AI society.
