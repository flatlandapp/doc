**Scene One: The Entrance to the Ruins**

**Text:** On the edge of Flatland, ancient and mysterious geometric ruins stand tall. A team consisting of Dr. Square, Tri Knight, Scholar Rhombus, and Duke Circle stands before a massive entrance formed by countless broken lines.

**Scene Two: The Narrow Passage**

**Text:** Through the twisted entrance, they enter a narrow passage. The walls on both sides are covered with incomprehensible symbols, the light is dim, and they can only pass through in single file. Tri Knight carefully leads the way.

**Scene Three: The Open "Room"**

**Text:** At the end of the passage, the space suddenly opens up, and they arrive in a relatively spacious "room." Strange geometric fragments are scattered on the floor, and in the center of the room is a complex pattern composed of countless tiny dots.

**Scene Four: The Secret of the Pattern**

**Text:** Scholar Rhombus carefully studies the dot pattern on the ground. "This seems to be an ancient script, or perhaps... a dimensional marker?" he mutters to himself. At this moment, Duke Circle accidentally touches one of the dots in the pattern, and the entire pattern suddenly emits a faint glow.

**Scene Five: The Dimensional Rift**

**Text:** As the light intensifies, a fine crack appears in the center of the pattern, where the "space" seems to become distorted. Tri Knight immediately stands guard in front. "Careful! That could be something dangerous!"

**Scene Six: The Unknown Revelation**

**Text:** The crack grows larger, revealing strange sights from withinâ€”twisted shapes and colors that cannot be explained by Flatland's geometry. Scholar Rhombus exclaims, "This... could this be a fragment of a higher dimension?!"
